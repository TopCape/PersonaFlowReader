If you are using the HD UI textures from https://gamebanana.com/mods/309876, simply replace the 2FontB.png file in your PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10432/Text folder.

Otherwise, place 2FontB.png and textures.ini in your PSP/TEXTURES/ULUS10432 folder.

NOTE: As of right now, it will look weird and not aligned. The texture file will also make some letters look HD if this is the only texture you are replacing.
